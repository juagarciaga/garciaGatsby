##### **Social:**

- Sometimes I tweet [@garcia_juliang](https://twitter.com/garcia_juliang).

##### **Media:**

- A [nice summary](https://phys.org/news/2019-07-visible-key-large-scale-cooperation.html) of our recent work on pro-social institutions to enable large-scale cooperation.
- My work on repeated games was featured in [Science](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/337/6100/1304), [scienceomega](http://www.scienceomega.com/) and [science daily]().
- I was interviewed for [an article on I, Science](https://isciencemag.co.uk/news/simulating-the-cooperation-dilemma/) about the role of computational models in understanding evolution.

##### **Miscellaneous:**

- I like [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/) and [Radiolab](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab). Radiolab has three episodes related to my research: [morality](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/episodes/91508-morality) (about how humans have a sense to tell right from wrong), [the good show](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/episodes/103951-the-good-show) (on how evolution can reward cooperation) and [argentine invasion](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/articles/226523-ants) (about us vs themstrategies in ants).
- I enjoy [films](https://www.imdb.com/user/ur11039329/ratings), [books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1567950-julian), reading the newspaper in print and playing tennis. [Roberto Bolaño](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Bola%C3%B1o) is my homeboy.
